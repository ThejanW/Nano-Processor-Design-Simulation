# Nano-Processor Design Simulation
A Nano-processor which is capable of executing assembly language codes was designed as a project. The Nano-processor was developed using Xilinx ISE and system was implemented on a BASYS 2 board. The Nano-processor is equipped with a basic Add-Subtract unit which is capable of executing basic mathematical operations.
